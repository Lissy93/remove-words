>A node module that returns an array of all words in a string that are not a pronoun or generic words.

This can be used for storing just the keywords of a string in a database and not wasting space with words like 'and', 'to', 'the'... which are unlikely to be searched for in a query.


## Installation
```yarn add remove-words --save```


## Example
```javascript
var removeWords =  require('remove-words');

removeWords("Today is sunny so we are going to go swimming at the seaside");
// Will return: ['today', 'sunny', 'swimming', 'seaside']


```

## Removing duplicates
By default all duplicates will be removed. The second (optional) parameter is a
boolean, specifiying weather of not to remove duplicates.

```javascript
removeWords("Hello world hello hello", true); // ["hello", "world"]
removeWords("Hello world hello hello", false); // ["hello", "world", "hello", "hello"]
```

## Using a custom word list
```javascript

var names = ['jack', 'john', 'joe', 'james', 'jim']
removeWords("The winners are: Jack, John and Jim!!!", true, names)
// Will remove just all names
```

## Features
- Case insensitive
- Handles special characters, URL's and other non standard strings
- By default doesn't return any duplicates, but can be specified in 2nd parameter
- Doesn't return blanks or special characters
- Thoroughly unit tested
- Words list is customisable, optionally pass in your own array as the third parameter


## Tests
